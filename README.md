# Hardware Sony Branches Info

## Thirteen: Any device

Also, this branch may also have some specific commits like for example moving amplifier or libpermgr to it from the DT to hw_sony, so it's recommended to use the Thirteen-Core in some cases (e.g. the 10 III) instead of the Thirteen (or Thirteen-Menu) branch.

## Thirteen-Menu: Any device

Same as the Thirteen branch, but the Xperia Parts menu is in Settings > Xperia Parts instead of Settings > System > Xperia Parts. (Because some ROMs do not support custom settings on the main page of the Settings so that is why the default branch keeps it in System)
This branch is useful for ROMs like AlphaDroid or ROMs with the stock AOSP Settings.

## Thirteen-Core: Any Device

A clean branch without any extra dependecies like an sony_extra repo, this branch can be built as is.
